1. **GPA calculator**

<br>

Set up a script that will calculate a GPA for a student’s semester report card. It should do the following:

<br>

• Ask the user how many courses they took that semester.
   Include input validation to make sure that the user enters a valid number

<br>

• For each course,
  o Ask how many units the course had
     Include input validation to make sure that the user enters a valid number
  o Ask for the letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
     Include another input validation to make sure that the user enters a valid grade

<br>

• Calculate and report the student’s overall GPA, rounded to two decimal places.

<br>

Note on calculating GPA:
An A receives 4 points, a B 3 points, a C 2 points, a D 1 point, and an F gets zero points.
Those points are multiplied by the number of units for that class.
These totals are then summed together for all classes and then divided by the total number of units.

<br>

Example:
If I received an A in a 3-unit class, a B in a 4-unit class, and a C in a 5-unit class, I would calculate this GPA:

4 × 3 + 3 × 4 + 2 × 5
----------------------- = 2.83
   3 + 4 + 5

2. **Fitting Data to a Function**

<br>

Create a script that will read the data for the world population from 1951 to 2023 from the Excel file
“PopulationData.xlxs”. Then, plot the population by year (with individual points like o’s or x’s – not a line) using
linear, loglog, and semilogy scaled plots. From the graphs, determine which type of function (linear, power, or
exponential) would make the best fit for this data. Then,

<br>

• overlay the plot of that function (with a line) on the appropriate (linear, loglog, or semilogy) graph
• provide a statement that states:
  This data fits best to a __________ function, described by
  y = __________

<br>

• Create a second statement, giving the predicted world population in 2050, using that function, similar to this:
  The predicted world population in 2050 is __________ (or ______ billion).
  (Round the billion value to one decimal place.)

3. **Develop a Game**

<br>

Set up a script that will play a game involving some random chance (rolling dice, picking a card, flipping
a coin, etc). It does not have to be a real game that exists. In fact, I would prefer if you just make up a
game of some sort. Explain the rules of your game in comments or in fprintf statements.

<br>

The game should cycle through a few rounds or continue until the user decides to quit.

<br>

Note: I am looking for you to show me your use of if/else statements and loops in this exercise.
Get creative with this one and have some fun!

4. **Apply MATLAB to Another Class**

<br>

Similar to the first project, create a script that will solve a problem from another class (calculus, physics,
chemistry, different engineering class, ...). Now, we have learned more techniques. So, look toward using
if/else statements, switch statements, loops, advanced graphing methods, and curve-fitting techniques in
this exercise.

<br>

Remember, you are trying to show off your MATLAB skills from this section. So, try to make this so that it
is not super basic but shows off what you can do.
